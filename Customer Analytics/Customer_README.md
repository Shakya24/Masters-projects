## Project Background
Established in 2018, this beauty store (retail and online) offers a diverse range of skincare, makeup, and personal care products to customers in Singapore and Malaysia. In this project, I partnered with this brand's Digital Campaign Manager to analyse real customer data to uncover trends in behavior, product preferences, and operational efficiency. The analysis addressed critical challenges, including customer retention, decision fatigue caused by an extensive product range, and the need for personalized shopping experiences.Based on the findings, I delivered actionable recommendations to enhance customer engagement and drive sustainable business growth.

## About-data

The dataset provides comprehensive information on customer transactions for 2022 and 2023, covering details such as purchase dates, countries, stores, brands, product categories, sales channels, and other product-specific information. This rich dataset offers a holistic view of customer purchasing behavior across various dimensions, enabling in-depth analysis and actionable insights.

Steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis can be found [here](Masters-projects/Customer%20Analytics/Data%20cleaning%20Customer.pdf)


## Summary of Insights

The exploratory data analysis phase of the project helped me uncover following key insights:

**Sales and Brand Insights**

  -  Sales by Brand:
    92% of products are sold primarily in retail stores, while 8% are sold through eCommerce channels.
    Brand D and Brand B have a significantly higher share of eCommerce sales (30%) compared to other brands (average of 5%).
    Home collection products contribute to 25% of total sales for Brand D and Brand F, making it a key category for these brands.

 -  Free Product Distribution:
   Fragrances account for 45% of free products distributed, followed by skincare at 30%.
   65% of free skincare products were distributed via eCommerce channels compared to 35% via retail.
   Despite this, the sales of skincare products declined by 12% over the last year, suggesting limited effectiveness of free sample strategies.
