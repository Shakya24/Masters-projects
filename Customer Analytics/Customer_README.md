## Project Background
Established in 2018, this beauty retail store offers a diverse range of skincare, makeup, and personal care products to customers worldwide. In this project, I partnered with the Digital Campaign Manager to analyse real customer data to uncover trends in behavior, product preferences, and operational efficiency. The analysis addressed critical challenges, including customer retention, decision fatigue caused by an extensive product range, and the need for personalized shopping experiences.Based on the findings, I delivered actionable recommendations to enhance customer engagement and drive sustainable business growth.
