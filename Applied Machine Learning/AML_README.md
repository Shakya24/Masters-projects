## Project Background
Established in 2018, Store-X beauty store (retail and online) offers a diverse range of skincare, makeup, and personal care products to customers in Singapore and Malaysia. In this project, I partnered with this brand's Digital Campaign Manager to analyse real customer data to uncover trends in behavior, product preferences, and operational efficiency. The analysis addressed critical challenges, including customer retention, decision fatigue caused by an extensive product range, and the need for personalized shopping experiences.Based on the findings, I delivered actionable recommendations to enhance customer engagement and drive sustainable business growth.

## About-data

The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).The simulation process was conducted utilizing the Sparkov Data Generation tool developed by Brandon Harris. This tool facilitated the generation of synthetic transactional data by defining a range of merchants, customers, and transaction categories. Our data contains 22 columns and ~1 million rows pertaining to credit card
information of 1,000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

Steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/Shakya24/Masters-projects/blob/main/Customer%20Analytics/Data%20cleaning%20Customer.pdf)
