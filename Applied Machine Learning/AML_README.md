## Project Background
This project on Credit Card Fraud Prediction focuses on implementing strategies and technologies to proactively identify and mitigate fraudulent activities in credit transactions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis, the project aims to develop a robust system that can detect unusual patterns and suspicious behaviors indicative of fraud.

## About-data

The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).The simulation process was conducted utilizing the Sparkov Data Generation tool developed by Brandon Harris. This tool facilitated the generation of synthetic transactional data by defining a range of merchants, customers, and transaction categories. Our data contains 22 columns and ~1 million rows pertaining to credit card
information of 1,000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

Steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/Shakya24/Masters-projects/blob/main/Customer%20Analytics/Data%20cleaning%20Customer.pdf)
