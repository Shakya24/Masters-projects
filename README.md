- [Customer Analytics](Customer%20Analytics/Customer_README.md) : By analyzing Store-Xâ€™s transaction data, I utilized advanced **customer segmentation** and **predictive modeling** techniques to uncover actionable insights. From identifying high-value customers to predicting churn using machine learning (AUC: 0.98), I highlighted factors like purchase frequency and category preferences. By integrating these findings into tailored **cross-selling** and **customer engagement** strategies, my recommendations aim to optimize inventory, reduce churn, and drive sustainable growth.
